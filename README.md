# C-projects
It's my own repository for my C# studying and developing.
# Why I created it?
To record every line the code I wrote, also to provide a example to others who want to learn C#.
# Postscript
You can use the code in the resource library freely, but when you want to develop some funictions which depends on my code, you should add a P.S. to explain where you get the code, and the author.
